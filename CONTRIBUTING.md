I'm really glad you're reading this, because I need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

I published python code that demonstrates getting public posts from a user's or community's wall on VK.com. I would like this to grow to include many more VK API endpoints. 

I hope you are interested and have a chance to help!
